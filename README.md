BeadTracker
===========

Complete magnetic tweezers setup code in LabView as used in the Nynke Dekker Lab, TUDelft, Netherlands (http://nynkedekkerlab.tudelft.nl/).
Using qtrk for image processing (see submodule), so hundreds of beads can be tracked simultaneously.

This code is used on several setups within our lab. It does need some work to get running on each specific hardware configuration.
(different motors, camera's, etc).
